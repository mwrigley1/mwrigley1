<h4><b>Round 1. Wild Card Series vs. St. Louis Cardinals</b></h4>

<p>The first test for the Phillies in the postseason was the St Louis Cardinals. The Cards also had a first-year Manager in Oliver Marmol, and finished the regular season with a 93-69 record to lead the National League Central Division. </p>

<h4><b>Round 2. Divisional Series vs. Atlanta Braves</b></h4>

<p>The Atlanta Braves awaited the Phillies next. The Braves won the World Series in 2021, shocking the Houston Astros. The Phillies were hoping to prevent them from getting back there again.</p>

<p>The Phillies beat down on the Braves, sending them home in just 4 games. After dropping game 2, the Phillies won games 3 and 4 in Philadelphia to close out the series and avoid a winner-takes-all game 5 in Atlanta. The postseason atmosphere returned to South Philly and did not disappoint.</p>

<p><b>Key Stat:</b> The Phillies' pitchers kept the Braves On Base Percentage to .250. The Braves' pitchers let the Phillies on base 33.1% of the time.</p>

<h4><b>Round 3. NL Championship Series vs. San Diego Padres</b></h4>

<p>The National League Championship Series was a showdown featuring the two premium position players in the 2019 Free Agent class: Bryce Harper of the Phillies and Manny Machado of the Padres.</p>

<p>While the series had many exciting moments, the Phillies took care of business in five games, advancing to the World Series for the first time since 2009.</p>

<p><b>Key Stat:</b> The Phillies' pitching staff gave up an average of 3.68 runs per nine innings. The Padres' pitching staff gave up an average of 5.36 runs per nine innings.</p>

<h4><b>Round 4. World Series vs. Houston Astros</b></h4>

<p>The World Series... nobody expected the Phillies to get here. They captured the NL pennant for the first time in 13 years, and they did it as underdogs in every series. Unfortunately, they would once again be labeled underdogs in the World Series, as they would face off against the clear cut best team in the league, the Houston Astros.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-cards" data-src="visualisation/12186804"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<p>The Phillies would see their magical season come to an end at the hands of the Houston Astros in six games in the World Series. They fought hard, but the Astros pitching was too dominant for the Phils to handle.</p>

 <p><b>Key Stat:</b> The Phillies hit only .163 in the World Series. The Astros hit .240.</p>
