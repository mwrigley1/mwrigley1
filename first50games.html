       <p>The team started the season 21-29 and sat third in their division. On June 2, 2022, the front office decided it was time for a change of voice in the locker room. So, they fired Manager Joe Girardi.</p>

       <blockquote>"I think we can make the playoffs. I think we're in a position where we can battle back to do that. I do believe that." - Dave Dombrowski, Phillies President of Baseball Operations</blockquote>

       <p> Next in line to lead the Phillies was Rob Thomson, a lifelong baseball man nicknamed Topper who had earned the respect of the entire clubhouse. Despite this, baseball writers and analysts did not see the move helping the Phillies, who many believed were too far gone. </p>
