 <p>The Phillies used a next-man-up mentality to win games they probably shouldn't have. Credit can (and should) be given to every player on the team, but here are a few worth highlighting.</p>

      </ul>

      <p>You can't talk about difference makers on the Phillies without talking about JT Realmuto. Known as the best catcher in the league, JT dominated on both sides of the ball by the end of the season, but struggled mightily out the gate.</p>

      <p>Kyle Schwarber was built to play for the Philadelphia Phillies. He's a left-handed batter who can send baseballs into oblivion to all parts of the field. However, he has a knack for being inconsistent, struggling early in the season and finding his stride almost every June. He's even received the nickname <i>June Schwarber</i> for his incredible hitting in June. This season was no different: Schwarber hit 12 home runs in June and his success carried over into July where he hit another 10.</p>

<p>Aaron Nola has been on the Phillies for his entire seven-year career. The talent was always there for the 2014 first round pick, but the question surrounding Nola was his ability to pitch in big games. The 2022 playoff run was the perfect opportunity for him to prove he can pitch when it matters, and he stepped up. </p>



<h3><b>End of Season Push</b></h3>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-bar-chart-race" data-src="visualisation/12080368"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<p>The end of the 2022 regular season was one to remember. Despite the Phillies' surge to finish the season with a record above .500, the New York Mets and the Atlanta Braves were <i>on fire</i> and actually played each other in the penultimate series of the regular season. This series would end up determining who would win the National League East, and who would avoid playing in the <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10051304-mlb-playoffs-2022-explaining-wild-card-format-divisional-series-and-more" target="_blank">Wild Card series</a>.</p>

<p>The Braves were hosting the Mets for the most important series of the season for any team. On September 30, Atlanta sat 1 game behind New York for first place in the National League East. Because the two teams were playing each other, each win was that much more important.</p>

<p>September 30 through October 2, the baseball world's eyes were all on Truist Park in Atlanta, Georgia. Both the Braves and the Mets had already clinched playoff spots, but the division was still up for grabs. Whoever won the series would almost certainly take home the NL East title.</p>

<p>Game 1 was won by Atlanta. Game 2... Atlanta. Game 3, Atlanta won that one too. The Braves swept the Mets in their three-game series to take home the National League East title. (Both teams ended with 101 wins, but Atlanta owned the tiebreaker against New York because they won the season series 10 games to 9.)</p>

<br>

<h3><i>Meanwhile...</i></h3>  

<p>With three games left to play, the Phillies put themselves in a position to clinch a playoff spot pretty much right at the buzzer. Their opponent: the Houston Astros. The Phillies had to win just ONE more game and they were in.</p>

<h4><b>The Game that Set the Tone</b></h4>

<p><i>10/3/2022</i></p>
<p><i>Minute Maid Park</i></p>
<p><i>Houston, TX</i></p>
<p><i>Game #160</i></p>

<p>Houston's Lance McCullers took the mound as the clock hit 7:10 local time on a Monday night. Up first to the plate to face him: Left Fielder Kyle Schwarber. McCullers winds, deals, and... <b><i>CRACK</i></b>: a deep drive to left field, GONE! A leadoff home run gave the Phillies a 1-0 lead before the fans could even get settled in their seats.</p>

<p>Pitching for the Phillies to try to clinch the playoffs: Aaron Nola. The storyline was already written: longtime Phillies pitcher and ace clinches first playoff birth for his team since 2011. All he had to do was perform. And perform he did.</p>

<p>Nola didn't give up a hit until the 7th inning, when Houston's power-hitting Designated Hitter Yordan Alvarez lined a single to right field. After conceding another single to David Hensley, Nola was pulled from the game. He finished his night pitching 6 2/3 innings, allowing 2 hits and striking out 9 batters.</p>

<p>The Phillies added on two more runs in the top of the 8th inning thanks to home runs from Bryson Stott and Kyle Schwarber (his second of the game). At this point, up 3-0, confidence started creeping into player's and fan's heads alike. The final out was recorded, and for the first time in 11 years, the Philadelphia Phillies were playoff bound.</p>
