      <p class="caption"><b>Part 1: Setting the Scene</b></p>

      <p>The Philadelphia Phillies are one of the oldest teams in Major League Baseball. They have been around for 140 seasons (since 1883), and have made the playoffs a total of 15 times.</p>

      

      <p>Every season, each of the 30 MLB teams plays 162 games. Prior to the season, according to <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/33647294/2022-mlb-season-preview-power-rankings-playoff-odds-everything-need-all-30-teams" target="_blank">ESPN's preseason power rankings</a>, the Phillies had a projected record of 89-73. and a 67% chance to make the playoffs.</p>

      <p>The 2022 Philadelphia Phillies started the season with high expectations. They had gone over the <a href="https://www.mlb.com/glossary/transactions/competitive-balance-tax" target="_blank">luxury tax</a> for the first time in team history. They bolstered their lineup to hit more home runs than any team in the league. But it never came together.</p>



      <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11785977"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

      <p>The team started the season 21-29 and sat third in their division. On June 2, 2022, the front office decided it was time for a change of voice in the locker room. So, they fired Manager Joe Girardi. Next in line to lead the Phillies was Rob Thomson, a lifelong baseball man nicknamed Topper who had earned the respect of the entire clubhouse. Despite this, baseball writers and analysts did not see the move helping the Phillies, who many believed were too far gone. </p>

      <p>The Phillies hit their stride immediately under Rob Thomson. The team won 8 straight to even their record at 30-30. </p>

      <p>The Phillies used a next-man-up mentality to win games they probably shouldn't have. Credit can (and should) be given to every player on the team, but here are a few worth highlighting.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b><a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/j-t-realmuto-592663?stats=statcast-r-hitting-mlb" target="_blank">J.T. Realmuto</a></b></li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can't talk about difference makers on the Phillies without talking about JT Realmuto. Known as the best catcher in the league, JT dominated on both sides of the ball by the end of the season, but struggled mightily out the gate.</p>

<!-- Insert Visual comparing JT's first half stats and his second half stats -->

      <ul>
        <li><b><a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/kyle-schwarber-656941?stats=statcast-r-hitting-mlb" target="_blank">Kyle Schwarber</a></b></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Kyle Schwarber was built to play for the Philadelphia Phillies. He's a left-handed batter who can send baseballs into oblivion to all parts of the field. However, he has a knack for being inconsistent, struggling early in the season and finding his stride almost every June. He's even received the nickname <i>June Schwarber</i> for his incredible hitting in June. This season was no different: Schwarber hit 12 home runs in June and his success carried over into July where he hit another 10.</p>

      <p>Improbably, the Phillies snuck into the playoffs after finishing the season with a 87-75 record, good for third in the NL East and the third (and final) <a href ="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-playoff-picture-bracket-standings-new-format-explained-with-12-team-postseason-field-set/" target="_blank">National League Wild Card</a> spot. </p>
