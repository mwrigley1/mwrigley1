       <p>The team started the season 21-29 and sat third in their division. On June 2, 2022, the front office decided it was time for a change of voice in the locker room. So, they fired Manager Joe Girardi.</p>

       <blockquote>"I think we can make the playoffs. I think we're in a position where we can battle back to do that. I do believe that." - Dave Dombrowski, Phillies President of Baseball Operations</blockquote>

       <p> Next in line to lead the Phillies was Rob Thomson, a lifelong baseball man nicknamed Topper who had earned the respect of the entire clubhouse. Despite this, baseball writers and analysts did not see the move helping the Phillies, who many believed were too far gone. </p>

        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Firing Joe Girardi wouldn’t fix Phillies’ problems.

 <p>The Phillies used a next-man-up mentality to win games they probably shouldn't have. Credit can (and should) be given to every player on the team, but here are a few worth highlighting.</p>


<ul>
        <li><b><a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/j-t-realmuto-592663?stats=statcast-r-hitting-mlb" target="_blank">J.T. Realmuto</a></b></li>
      </ul>



      <img src="https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/bbWi0SW2RjHfSvyNMwZ2iylCYTc=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-pmn/public/VZF66OQRLND5FK3DTMTGFARQJA.jpg" class="img-fluid" />

      <p>You can't talk about difference makers on the Phillies without talking about JT Realmuto. Known as the best catcher in the league, JT dominated on both sides of the ball by the end of the season, but struggled mightily out the gate.</p>


     <br> 

<ul>
        <li><b><a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/kyle-schwarber-656941?stats=statcast-r-hitting-mlb" target="_blank">Kyle Schwarber</a></b></li>
      </ul>

<br>

      <p>Kyle Schwarber was built to play for the Philadelphia Phillies. He's a left-handed batter who can send baseballs into oblivion to all parts of the field. However, he has a knack for being inconsistent, struggling early in the season and finding his stride almost every June. He's even received the nickname <i>June Schwarber</i> for his incredible hitting in June. This season was no different: Schwarber hit 12 home runs in June and his success carried over into July where he hit another 10.</p>

<p>Aaron Nola has been on the Phillies for his entire seven-year career. The talent was always there for the 2014 first round pick, but the question surrounding Nola was his ability to pitch in big games. The 2022 playoff run was the perfect opportunity for him to prove he can pitch when it matters, and he stepped up. </p>



<h3><b>End of Season Push</b></h3>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-bar-chart-race" data-src="visualisation/12080368"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<p>The end of the 2022 regular season was one to remember. Despite the Phillies' surge to finish the season with a record above .500, the New York Mets and the Atlanta Braves were <i>on fire</i> and actually played each other in the penultimate series of the regular season. This series would end up determining who would win the National League East, and who would avoid playing in the <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10051304-mlb-playoffs-2022-explaining-wild-card-format-divisional-series-and-more" target="_blank">Wild Card series</a>.</p>

<p>The Braves were hosting the Mets for the most important series of the season for any team. On September 30, Atlanta sat 1 game behind New York for first place in the National League East. Because the two teams were playing each other, each win was that much more important.</p>

<p>September 30 through October 2, the baseball world's eyes were all on Truist Park in Atlanta, Georgia. Both the Braves and the Mets had already clinched playoff spots, but the division was still up for grabs. Whoever won the series would almost certainly take home the NL East title.</p>

<p>Game 1 was won by Atlanta. Game 2... Atlanta. Game 3, Atlanta won that one too. The Braves swept the Mets in their three-game series to take home the National League East title. (Both teams ended with 101 wins, but Atlanta owned the tiebreaker against New York because they won the season series 10 games to 9.)</p>

<br>

<h3><i>Meanwhile...</i></h3>  

<p>With three games left to play, the Phillies put themselves in a position to clinch a playoff spot pretty much right at the buzzer. Their opponent: the Houston Astros. The Phillies had to win just ONE more game and they were in.</p>

<h4><b>The Game that Set the Tone</b></h4>

<p><i>10/3/2022</i></p>
<p><i>Minute Maid Park</i></p>
<p><i>Houston, TX</i></p>
<p><i>Game #160</i></p>

<p>Houston's Lance McCullers took the mound as the clock hit 7:10 local time on a Monday night. Up first to the plate to face him: Left Fielder Kyle Schwarber. McCullers winds, deals, and... <b><i>CRACK</i></b>: a deep drive to left field, GONE! A leadoff home run gave the Phillies a 1-0 lead before the fans could even get settled in their seats.</p>

<p>Pitching for the Phillies to try to clinch the playoffs: Aaron Nola. The storyline was already written: longtime Phillies pitcher and ace clinches first playoff birth for his team since 2011. All he had to do was perform. And perform he did.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/htIlVJqjmEU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Nola didn't give up a hit until the 7th inning, when Houston's power-hitting Designated Hitter Yordan Alvarez lined a single to right field. After conceding another single to David Hensley, Nola was pulled from the game. He finished his night pitching 6 2/3 innings, allowing 2 hits and striking out 9 batters.</p>

<p>The Phillies added on two more runs in the top of the 8th inning thanks to home runs from Bryson Stott and Kyle Schwarber (his second of the game). At this point, up 3-0, confidence started creeping into player's and fan's heads alike. The final out was recorded, and for the first time in 11 years, the Philadelphia Phillies were playoff bound.</p>

  <h3><b>Part 4: The Postseason</b></h3> 

<img src="https://img.mlbstatic.com/mlb-images/image/upload/t_16x9/t_w1024/mlb/sibqoshzzoqpsqbejnie.jpg" class="img-fluid">



<h4><b>Round 1. Wild Card Series vs. St. Louis Cardinals</b></h4>

<p>The first test for the Phillies in the postseason was the St Louis Cardinals. The Cards also had a first-year Manager in Oliver Marmol, and finished the regular season with a 93-69 record to lead the National League Central Division. </p>

 <div class="flourish-embed flourish-cards" data-src="visualisation/12160681"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

 <p>The Phillies used a balanced offensive attack combined with gems from Zack Wheeler and Aaron Nola to defeat the Cardinals 2 games to 0.</p>

 <p><b>Key Stat:</b> The Phillies outscored the Cardinals 8-3 in this two game series.</p>

  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XnovmC-DCn0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h4><b>Round 2. Divisional Series vs. Atlanta Braves</b></h4>

<p>The Atlanta Braves awaited the Phillies next. The Braves won the World Series in 2021, shocking the Houston Astros. The Phillies were hoping to prevent them from getting back there again.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-cards" data-src="visualisation/12161081"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<p>The Phillies beat down on the Braves, sending them home in just 4 games. After dropping game 2, the Phillies won games 3 and 4 in Philadelphia to close out the series and avoid a winner-takes-all game 5 in Atlanta. The postseason atmosphere returned to South Philly and did not disappoint.</p>

<p><b>Key Stat:</b> The Phillies' pitchers kept the Braves On Base Percentage to .250. The Braves' pitchers let the Phillies on base 33.1% of the time.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kW3Q7v9TaS8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h4><b>Round 3. NL Championship Series vs. San Diego Padres</b></h4>

<p>The National League Championship Series was a showdown featuring the two premium position players in the 2019 Free Agent class: Bryce Harper of the Phillies and Manny Machado of the Padres.</p>


<div class="flourish-embed flourish-cards" data-src="visualisation/12161344"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>


<p>While the series had many exciting moments, the Phillies took care of business in five games, advancing to the World Series for the first time since 2009.</p>

<p><b>Key Stat:</b> The Phillies' pitching staff gave up an average of 3.68 runs per nine innings. The Padres' pitching staff gave up an average of 5.36 runs per nine innings.</p> 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Y-pCNZYL-w" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h4><b>Round 4. World Series vs. Houston Astros</b></h4>

<p>The World Series... nobody expected the Phillies to get here. They captured the NL pennant for the first time in 13 years, and they did it as underdogs in every series. Unfortunately, they would once again be labeled underdogs in the World Series, as they would face off against the clear cut best team in the league, the Houston Astros.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-cards" data-src="visualisation/12186804"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<p>The Phillies would see their magical season come to an end at the hands of the Houston Astros in six games in the World Series. They fought hard, but the Astros pitching was too dominant for the Phils to handle.</p>

 <p><b>Key Stat:</b> The Phillies hit only .163 in the World Series. The Astros hit .240.</p>




 <h3><b>Part 5: What's Next?</b></h3> 

 <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IIQaYZHw1lC_uNqx_i_q5JFzQLo=/0x0:5568x3712/1400x933/filters:focal(2491x608:3381x1498):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71502405/usa_today_19239717.0.jpg" height="720" width="1280" class="img-fluid"/>

<p>"It was unbelievable," said former Phillies hitting coach Rob Potts. "The atmosphere reminded me of the Phillies' best years."</p>

<p>Before the 2020 season, the future of the Philadelphia Phillies was up in the air. They had veteran players signed to massive contracts that were being viewed as not worth it. Analysts were saying at this rate, no big named players would want to play in Philly.</p>

<p>Three full seasons later, the Phillies have turned everything around. They're reminding players and fans why South Philly is such an electric place to play.</p>

<p>Following their 2022 World Series run, the Phillies wasted no time. "I was at work, and got a text from my son," Potts explains. "He's freaking out, saying the Phillies signed Trea Turner."</p>

<figure>
      <img src="https://a.espncdn.com/media/motion/2022/1208/dm_221208_Trea_Turner_Presser/dm_221208_Trea_Turner_Presser.jpg" height="720" width="1280" class="img-fluid"/>
      <figcaption>New Phillies Shortstop Trea Turner (left)smiling with Dave Dombrowski (right) at his introductory press conference.
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>The Phillies signed Trea Turner to a 11 year, $300M contract on December 5, 2022. The narrative that Philadelphia was not a desired destination for big-named free agents was dead.</p>

<p>Turner said in his introductory press conference that he kept a close eye on the Phillies in the playoffs after his Dodgers got eliminated. He noted that the playoff atmosphere and knowing that the Phillies could win and compete in big games was a big part in making the decision to sign there.</p>

<p>"When I coached, the vibes were always high. The team had stars like Utley, Howard, and Rollins," said Potts, speaking on the team's core from the early 2000s. "The fans want to come watch these teams. It's exciting for not only them, but the players too."</p>
