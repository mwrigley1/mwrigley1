      <p>The Philadelphia Phillies are one of the oldest teams in Major League Baseball. They have been around for 140 seasons (since 1883), and have made the playoffs a total of 15 times.</p>


      <p>Every season, each of the 30 MLB teams plays 162 games. Prior to the season, according to <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/33647294/2022-mlb-season-preview-power-rankings-playoff-odds-everything-need-all-30-teams" target="_blank">ESPN's preseason power rankings</a>, the Phillies had a projected record of 89-73. and a 67% chance to make the playoffs.</p>

      <p>The last time the Phillies made the playoffs was 2011, the longest active playoff drought in the National League (the Seattle Mariners held the League's longest playoff drought, having not made the playoffs since 2001). Loyal fans were starving for another taste of postseason baseball in South Philly. In December of 2020, the team took a leap of faith, signing Dave Dombrowski as their first ever President of Baseball Operations.</p>

<p>Prior to the 2019 MLB offseason, Phillies owner John Middleton said that he was willing to spend "stupid money" to get the team out of mediocrity.</p>
